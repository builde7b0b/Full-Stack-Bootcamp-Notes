## Writing User Stories 

What are user Stories?

### What is INVEST? 
a principle to follow when writing user stories

### Why is it important that user stories exist independently?
Clarity, Prioritization, Flexibility, Accountability
 If user stories are not independent, it can be difficult to understand what each user wants and how it fits into the larger picture.

### Things to Remember: 
- Group Stories by Theme
- Use understandable language 
- group stories by themes 
- healthy backlog of user stories 

### AVOID:
- Ambiguous language (e.g., "easy," "simple," "seamless," "intuitive").
- Subjective or judgmental language (e.g., "better," "good," "allowable").
- Generalizations (e.g., "always," "never," "everyone").
- Observed behavior that isn't directly related to the story under consideration.
- Tautological stories that are self-defining.

### What is Acceptance Criteria? 
confirm when a user story is accepted, or done

#### Writing Acceptance Criteria 
Format: "Given that [context on the user], when [event happens or action is taken], then [outcome]."

#### What does acceptance criteria do? 
acceptance criteria focus on the "what" (the end result), not the "how" (the solution approach).

#### Example User Story Format
"As a [type of user], I want [a specific action or feature], so that [a specific benefit or value is achieved]


### Examples of user stories that follow the INVEST principles:

Independent: As a customer, I want to be able to order products online so that I can avoid going to the store.

Negotiable: As a sales manager, I want to be able to view sales reports by region so that I can make informed decisions about sales strategies. (Note: the details of the report may be negotiable based on the needs of the sales manager and the development team.)

Valuable: As a user, I want to be able to save items to a wish list so that I can easily find them later and purchase them.

Estimable: As a site administrator, I want to be able to batch process customer records so that I can update their subscription status quickly and efficiently.

Small: As a user, I want to be able to filter search results by price range so that I can find products that fit my budget.

Testable: As a user, I want to be able to create an account on the website so that I can access my order history. (Note: the acceptance criteria for this story may include verifying that the user can successfully create an account and that their order history is accurate.)

These user stories are well-defined, specific, and focused on delivering value to the user or customer. 
They are also small enough to be completed in a single development sprint and can be estimated in terms of time and resources required to complete. 
By following the INVEST principles, teams can create user stories that are more likely to result in a successful and efficient development process.



### Why are user stories important?
    User stories are important because they provide a clear and concise description of a specific feature or functionality from the perspective of the user or customer. They help ensure that the development team understands the needs and requirements of the user or customer and can deliver software that meets those needs. User stories also help teams prioritize work, track progress, and deliver features incrementally.

### What’s the recommended structure for writing user stories?
    The recommended structure for writing user stories is as follows: "As a [type of user], I want [a specific action or feature], so that [a specific benefit or value is achieved]." This structure helps ensure that user stories are focused on delivering value to the user or customer.

### Why are acceptance criteria important?
    Acceptance criteria are important because they define the specific conditions that must be met for a user story to be considered complete. They help ensure that the development team and the customer have a shared understanding of what is expected and what constitutes a successful outcome.

### What’s the recommended structure for defining acceptance criteria?
    The recommended structure for defining acceptance criteria is to use a list of specific, measurable, and testable conditions that must be met in order for the user story to be considered complete. The acceptance criteria should be written in a way that is clear and unambiguous, and should be based on the specific needs and requirements of the user or customer.

### What does INVEST mean?
INVEST is a set of principles for creating effective user stories. 
The acronym stands for:

- Independent: User stories should be independent of one another.
- Negotiable: User stories should be open to negotiation between the development team and the customer.
- Valuable: User stories should provide value to the customer or end-user.
- Estimable: User stories should be able to be estimated in terms of time and resources required to complete.
- Small: User stories should be small enough to be completed in a single development sprint.
- Testable: User stories should be testable.
