### What is an exception? 
an exception is an event that disrupts normal program execution and throws an error because of the unexpected conditions. 
An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. It's usually caused by an error in the program or unexpected conditions that prevent the program from functioning as expected.

### What is the purpose of try catch blocks?
To Catch exceptions that occur as a result of errors in the code. 

The purpose of try-catch blocks is to handle exceptions that may occur during program execution. The try block contains the code that might throw an exception, and the catch block is used to handle the exception if it's thrown.
